# Boiler Plate code for Spigot Plugin
This project is boilerplate code for a Spigot plugin, providing the basic structure necessary for creating a plugin. It includes a simple command that responds to user input via the /boilerplate syntax, handling interaction through the BoilerPlateCommand method. Additionally, it features an event listener that captures player interactions, such as player joins, and triggers actions using the @EventHandler annotation, demonstrating core functionality for event handling in Spigot plugins.
